  '<h1>Eagles Weekly</h1>
<p>Good morning, Eagles! Here is your weekly roundup of everything happening in our community.</p>

<h2>Habitat Build: 180 Hours, One House, One Family</h2>
<p>Last Saturday, 15 Eagles volunteers showed up at dawn and did not stop until sunset. Under Terrence Washington''s leadership, we framed walls, hung drywall, and made incredible progress on a four-bedroom home for the Martinez family. The family visited the site and the emotion was palpable — this is why we do what we do.</p>

<h2>Spring Food Drive — This Saturday!</h2>
<p>Our biggest food collection of the year is this Saturday at Exploration Place, 9 AM to 3 PM. We still need drivers for pickup routes — see the forum if you can help. Last year we collected over 4,000 pounds. Let us top that!</p>

<h2>Gala Update</h2>
<p>The Spring Gala is three weeks away and tickets are selling fast. Early-bird pricing ends Friday. We have some incredible silent auction items lined up, including a Lake Afton cabin weekend and dental care packages.</p>

<h2>By the Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>623</strong> coats distributed this winter</li>
<li><strong>180</strong> volunteer hours at the Habitat build</li>
<li><strong>15,000+</strong> cumulative volunteer hours since 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep soaring, Eagles!</p>

<p>Happy Monday, Eagles! What a weekend we had.</p>

<h2>Food Drive Smashes Records</h2>
<p>Saturday''s Annual Spring Food Drive at Exploration Place was our most successful yet — we collected over <strong>4,800 pounds of food</strong> and $2,300 in cash donations. That is enough to stock shelves at 12 distribution sites across Sedgwick County. Thank you to every volunteer who sorted, packed, and delivered.</p>

<h2>Spring Gala — Two Weeks Away</h2>
<p>The Eagles Spring Gala is on the horizon and we are putting the finishing touches on what promises to be an unforgettable evening. Dinner, silent auction, live music by the Wichita Jazz Orchestra, and our Volunteer of the Year award. Get your tickets before they are gone!</p>

<h2>Volunteer Spotlight: Diana Flores</h2>
<p>This month''s Volunteer of the Month is Diana Flores, our Community Outreach chair. Diana organized the coat drive, coordinates Spanish-language outreach, and still finds time to train new volunteers. We are so lucky to have her.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

<li><strong>Youth Mentoring Saturday</strong> — Community Center, 7 days out</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer Training Workshop</strong> — Eagles HQ, 14 days out</li>

  <h1>About The Eagles — Good Samaritans of Wichita</h1>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>The Eagles were founded in 2014 by a small group of Wichita neighbors who believed that everyday people could create extraordinary change. What started as a weekend food drive in a church parking lot has grown into one of Sedgwick County''s most active volunteer organizations, with over 200 members and 15,000 cumulative volunteer hours.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We exist to lift our community — one neighbor at a time. Through hands-on volunteering, food security programs, youth mentoring, habitat builds, and community outreach, The Eagles connect people who want to help with people who need it most.</p>

  <h2>Our Values</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service First</strong> — We show up, roll up our sleeves, and do the work.</li>
    <li><strong>Every Neighbor Matters</strong> — We serve all Wichitans regardless of background, identity, or circumstance.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — Every dollar donated and every hour volunteered is accounted for and reported.</li>
    <li><strong>Joy in Giving</strong> — Volunteering is not a chore. It is a privilege that enriches the giver as much as the receiver.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Over Ego</strong> — We celebrate collective impact, not individual recognition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>The Eagles operate year-round programs including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Food Drives & Holiday Baskets</strong> — Collecting and distributing thousands of pounds of food annually</li>
    <li><strong>Habitat Builds</strong> — Partnering with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for Wichita families</li>
    <li><strong>Youth Mentoring</strong> — One-on-one mentoring for at-risk teens, with a focus on education and career readiness</li>
    <li><strong>Community Garden</strong> — Growing fresh produce donated to local food pantries</li>
    <li><strong>Coat & Supply Drives</strong> — Keeping families warm in winter and kids prepared for school</li>
    <li><strong>Home Repairs</strong> — Fixing porches, plumbing, and safety hazards for elderly and low-income homeowners</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>By the Numbers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>12 years</strong> of service to Wichita</li>
    <li><strong>200+</strong> active members and volunteers</li>
    <li><strong>15,000+</strong> cumulative volunteer hours</li>
    <li><strong>5,000+</strong> neighbors directly helped</li>
    <li><strong>350</strong> holiday food baskets delivered last year</li>
    <li><strong>800 lbs</strong> of produce grown in our community garden</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Leadership</h2>
  <p>The Eagles are governed by a volunteer Board of Directors and led by six standing committees: Fundraising, Community Outreach, Youth Programs, Events Planning, Communications & Media, and the Board itself. Every member has a voice and a vote.</p>

  <p><strong>President:</strong> Marcus Reid — founding member, retired teacher, and lifelong Wichitan.</p>
